# GPT Paint

Have GPT Paint a webpage for you.

This is an experimental repository. You can run it after cloning the repo by running these two commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and
```
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:5000 and check out what GPT makes for you (note: it will cache the result after the first time, restart the server if you want more attempts).
